# AGENT_LOG – AI Usage Notes

## Purpose of This Log

This document explains how AI tools were used during the development of this project.
The intent was to use AI as a productivity aid while maintaining clear human ownership
of architectural, product, and UX decisions.

---

## How AI Was Used

AI tools were used to accelerate development and exploration.

They assisted with:
- Brainstorming feature ideas inspired by real ATS products
- Suggesting UI layouts for recruiter and candidate experiences
- Generating initial component scaffolds
- Helping debug Next.js App Router issues
- Improving accessibility and SEO structure

---

## Human Decisions and Overrides

All key decisions were made manually.

This includes:
- Defining recruiter vs candidate responsibilities
- Deciding what features were in scope
- Making architectural and routing decisions
- Refining UX interactions to match real-world hiring platforms

AI suggestions were reviewed critically and modified or rejected when they did not align
with the project goals or assignment constraints.

## What Was Not Done Using AI

The following areas were intentionally handled without AI-generated output:
- Final architectural decisions
- Deployment configuration and debugging
- Demo video narration
- Submission preparation and validation

---

## Learnings

Through this project, the following learnings emerged:
- How to design recruiter-focused configuration tools
- How to build candidate-facing job discovery experiences
- How to collaborate with AI without losing solution ownership
- The importance of small UX details in hiring products
